# Regression EC with Real Life Machine Learning Dataset 

Used six different machine learning )medical and non-medical) datasets to analyze the newly proposed regression error consistency metrics (EC) metrics. Here, we used 5-fold external holdout cross-validation and we repeated the process 50 times.


Use `python3 -m run --dataset=Dataset_Name --progress` to execute the main function!

##### Argument Passing

You need to choose the `Dataset_Name` like "Boston", "Bike", etc to execute the program for the respective dataset. Additionally, if you want to see the progress bar then use `--progress`, otherwise ignore it.
